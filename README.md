# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Description

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is an advanced machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on medical parameters. This system aims to assist healthcare providers in identifying potential health risks in their patients. It employs multiple machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve high accuracy in disease prediction.
